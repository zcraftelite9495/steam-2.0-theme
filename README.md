# Steam 2.0
Theme by ZcraftElite for Steam forked from SpaceTheme
## How to install?

Step 1. Install [Millenium](https://steambrew.app/).

Step 2. Download the zip file and unzip it into the steamui\skins folder (located in the Steam Program Files Folder)

Step 3. Open Steam, goto theme settings, and select ZcraftElite's Steam 2.0

## What features does this have compared to SpaceTheme?

1. Configurable Splash & Loading screen on steam startup
2. Better expirimental features and easy customization of the colors of the steam logo

That doesn't sound like much, I know, but we are currently at version 1.1.0, so in the future I will be sure to incorporate more things to set Steam 2.0 apart form SpaceTheme.
